## Elevator Pitch

Knowledge, when mixed with different views and experiences on subjects, originates debates that frequently end with either or both of the parties involved acquiring more information on the subject. A different light on any topic enables the ability for a discussion to reach further than before.\
The idea behind Wikipedia is the pooling of the internet's knowledge in a single site. We want to pool the internet's discussion in a single site.\
This app allows the regular wikipedia-faring user to view and make comments under articles, to share ideas with other users, therefore intending for either or both of the parts to acquire new information, to learn.\
It also lets users rate each other's comments in an attempt for the public opinion to show the newer user what's right and what's wrong.\
Every user gets to customise their own profile and display name, as well as saving their favourite articles to browse later.\
It's easy to use and fulfills its purpose perfectly.
