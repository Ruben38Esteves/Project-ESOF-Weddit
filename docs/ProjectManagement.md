### Release
[Release v0.1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC04T2/releases/tag/v0.1)

### Retrospective

#### What went well?

We did a good job detailing the Logical and Physical aspects of our work in their respective architectural diagrams.

#### What didn’t go so well?

We failed to look into the inheritability of our project; we were very unspecific in various different fields and should detail our ideas and diagrams on a deeper level.

#### What have I learned?

We learned about the importance of planning things ahead, we found out the hard way how an organized team differs from an unorganized one.

#### What still puzzles me?

We still have problems using dart since we have never used it before and aren't aware of all its capabilities and features.
