## Product Vision

### Vision Statement

We aim to add a section to wikipedia articles so that debate and dialogue can ensue.

**Knowledge is to be shared.**

### Main Features
- Viewing articles - Without the ability to view the articles, how could you make a comment on them?
- Comments under the articles - The main principle behind our project. Discuss diverse ideas and ask questions under articles.
- Liking and disliking comments - This lets users rate the comments at will, to give the next user to read the comment an idea on how good/bad it is, according to the public.
- Ability to log in and create accounts - Without proper management behind who can comment we run into the problem of misinformation and "trolling".
- Moderator accounts - People with the power to manage the comments as previously mentioned.

### Assumptions and dependencies
- MediaWiki Wikipedia API to get the articles from.
- Firebase Auth API to create accounts and manage them.
- Firestore Database API to store data about users and the respective comments on articles.
